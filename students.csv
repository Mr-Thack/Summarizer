Student Coursework,"MAKE IT FASTER\nIn 2021-22, I could load up CTLS within 10 seconds. Worked flawlessly. It had few features, but it did what it needs to do - files and assignments.\nNow, after this update, the loading speed is horrendous. CTLS fails to load 2 times out of 3, and even on a successful load it can take more than a minute. Clicks go unresponsive, it randomly times out. Ive cleared by cache & tried multiple browsers. It doesn't happen with other websites.\nCurrently, CTLS is unusable. It is unacceptable that it takes 3-4 minutes for me to submit a SINGLE assignment when I used to be able to do it in 30 seconds.\nMy friends say the same things, so it's not an isolated issue. I am very technically savvy, and I have developed my own website and have set up an enterprise-grade network at my house, so I know a fair deal about networking. I know it's not my computer causing these slowdowns."
Global/system-wide,"Please make it so if you take a test on CTLS Assess, the grade automatically goes into Synergy."
Global/system-wide,"I liked the old design better... Can you guys change whatever ""coursework"" and all the other stuff to just assignments and resources? The animations and stuff are very cool,"
Global/system-wide,"I would love to see folders for the ""My Classes"" tab on CTLS Learn. This would allow students to sort classes into folders with different names and click on them to open them."
Student Coursework,"Please bring back the labels for the icons on CTLS Learn. It makes it difficult for parents and students when we ask them to access ""Student Coursework"" and there's no label (only an icon that doesn't really match). "
