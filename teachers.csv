CTLS Parent/communication,"As a teacher, we are encouraged to message parents from CTLS instead of from email. I would like a direct link to messaging instead of clicking on parent, home, and then messaging.",Please help messaging be more efficient.
Digital Classroom,Under Resources - it would be nice to be able to delete files that were accidentally added to the wrong class so that students don't get confused with content that pertains to their course resources. ,"A trash can under ""Resources"" in Digital Classroom so that teachers can drop files that need to be erased."
CTLS Parent/communication,Add CTLS Parent feature ,Unable to receive student absence notes submitted by parents. I am the attendance clerk. 
CTLS Parent/communication,I am the school nurse.  I would like the ability to contact parents of students who have come to the clinic sick or with complaints. Parents often do not answer their phones and many do not have active voice mailboxes set up - this makes it difficult to reach them. Most will answer and email sent by the school.,"A CTLS parent message is also helpful in the event they do not speak English, as they can translate the email on their phone or computer"
Digital Classroom,"If CTLS remains idle, it logs our teachers out. They are requesting the time-out trigger to be delayed to a longer setting, so it doesn't log them out as quickly.",n/a
CTLS Parent/communication,We would like to be able to upload pictures to families but when we go to the child there are 8 listings for them. It takes 12 clicks to get to send/ upload families the pictures of their kids.,We would like to send pictures easily through CTLS.
CTLS Parent/communication,Kindergarten teachers need an easier way to send photos. I would suggest a CTLS Photo- where I can take and send photos with less than 12 clicks. Can we make it work like Seesaw? I counted today and it took me 15 clicks to send photos for parents. Kindergarten parents LOVE these photos. Please please please make it easier,CTLS needs to be more kinder friendly
CTLS Parent/communication,please please please make it so each child only shows up one time when I try to send a message. I am having to scroll through 154 names to send a message to a parent. Each child is listed 7 times. once is plenty,please make it easier to use
Digital Classroom,"I would like to filter the students that have turned in a single assignment, missing that assignment, and already have that assignment graded within the gradebook. If a filter was located at the top of the assignment inside the gradebook, it would eliminate the excessive amount of scrolling and bunch the students into actionable groups.","The gradebook can filter ready to grade, missing, etc. But with 100+ students and 20+ assignments, by the end of the semester gradebook is overwhelming. If we could group students into actionable chunks: Missing, already graded, needs grading. When we make a list of students that need assistance or have to take the final, they are grouped together. "
Assess,"Currently in CTLS, the performance bands are different from the Georgia Milestones performance bands. Can they be changed to align with the performance bands on the Milestones? 
L1: 0-67
L2: 68-79
L3: 80-91
L4: 92-100",I am suggesting that the performance bands are the same as what obtains on the Georgia Milestones. 
Courses (teacher resources),"Our K team was discussing that it would be helpful to link the PowerPoints to use with the Enhanced Phonics lessons directly into the lesson. If this is possible, it would make things easier to access when teaching the lessons. This would make things more cohesive if they were embedded in the lesson plans as resources to use. ",This relates to the Enhanced Phonics Lessons/lesson plans that are located in CTLS- ELA- Kindergarten. 
Student Coursework,"Editing permission after pushing updates from one ""student coursework"" to another. ","CCCs often share and collaborate on a common CTLS classroom in order to share lesson plans and resources. Once the CCC classroom is done, each teacher can then ""push updates"" to their own CTLS classroom. Howver, once the updates are pushed, it can not be edited in that individual teachers CLTS. It says ""This content can only be edited in its original location."" We would like the ability to edit after the pushed update for circustances when one teacher's plan differs slightly from another.

Courses (teacher resources),"In the calendar feature, the recurring event feature is nice but it doesn't allow to delete the individual dates such as Fall break or Winter break.  If you delete one event out of the recurring event, the whole event gets deleted.  There should be a feature to delete only individual dates just like Google Calendar. ",N/A
Digital Classroom,"Zoom-- Teachers desperately need the ability to move everyone back into the waiting room with one click. This is important if there is a class disruption that needs to be dealt with (since we can't move them into break out rooms). This could also be managed if we could move all students into separate breakout rooms, but CCSD doesn't allow break out rooms. ",This is much needed for online class instruction.

CTLS Parent/communication,"Add a ""Send Later"" button in CTLS Parent messenger. ","I love the parent messenger. However, I would love the option to send at a later time. Often I receive messages after working hours and I open them to read them but don't want to respond right then. I would love to be able to say ""Send Later"" and select the time for the message to send. Several teachers also believe this would be helpful for teachers so we can respectfully set boundaries with parents. Adding this feature would greatly help us when we are working after hours but don't want parents to expect responses late at night from us. "
Assess,"When you print a copy of an assessment that includes a fill in the blank question on CTLS, it does not provide the answer choices for the blank and even includes the correct answer.

Global/system-wide,"The announcement widget on the CTLS-Teach homescreen is just a static list of announcements, which is not clickable and does not list what class/community the announcement is from. 

Can this widget be enhanced to 1) display which community/class the announcement is from, 2) make the announcements clickable so they take the user directly to that community/class, and 3) give users the option to display a condensed list/feed OR an expanded preview tile that shows a preview of the announcement tile.","The announcement tool could very useful for PLC's and other district level users to communicate content-related information; however, in its current format announcements are not displayed in a visually relevant way and users are not able to determine where the announcement originates from."

CTLS Parent/communication,"Last year I could send parent communication via CTLS by accessing the Parent Communication link at the bottom of the home page on CTLS (that is, my homepage as a teacher with my classes on it). That link was removed sometime over summer and is now accessible via CTLS Parent if I sign in with my teaching credentials and click through the correct things (even though I would never go there because I am not a parent of a child in the district). It would be great if that link could be restored to the bottom of the homepage.","I have screenshots and could attach those, but don't see a place to do that here."
CTLS Parent/communication,CTLS parent post templates should be able to be shared amongst teachers. ,Please make it possible for teams to share the CTLS parent posts to promote consistency across grade-levels. 
Professional Learning,Draw Feature,Having an upload feature would be a great addition.
Global/system-wide,Switching between users on CTLS learn app, I find it difficult to switch between the 2 accounts I have. Once I’m logged into one of my kids CTLS learn accounts it’s hard to log into the other. If I log out and then try to log back in it automatically leaves the current account as a default. If there is a way to make it easier to switch accounts that’ll be great. Like a button or a full log out and then a place to re enter a new user name etc. thank you!!
